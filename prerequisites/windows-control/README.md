# Prepare Windows Machine

* install linux subsystem
* following the installation process as in linux guide


* after - create project


Linux and Mac OS are supported out of the box. \
Using windows to run ansible is more tricky. \
Windows subsystem works, but if it is not available - installation [gets technical](./windows/Ansible-On-Windows.md).

When using winrm - you will need to install:
`pip install pywinrm`
